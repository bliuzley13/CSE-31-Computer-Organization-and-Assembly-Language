TPS 1:
1-4. Done
5. Because the program reads an input, there is no need to declare n in the data segment. The code will give an error if it was declaring in the .data segment.
6. It works

TPS 2:
1. It works
2-3. It is in the code
4. Register $t0
5. The returned value is in the $v0 register.
6. In code
7. Three integer values are reserved. These are $ra, $s0, and $s1. The $ra register is inserted first.
8-9. In code
10. $a0 needs to be saved into the stack so we can access this value later on after the first recursive call. 
11. In code
12. If recursion is called right away, the returned value from the previous recursion call is overwritten. 
13-14. In code
15. The return address is the value that needs to be retrieved so the program can return to the correct location of the code before returning to main.
