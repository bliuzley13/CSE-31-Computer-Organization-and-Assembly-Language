We know the following:
- avg_even is the digits that sum up to an even number
- avg_odd is the digits that sum up to an odd number

Parameters:
- 0 terminates any more input code
- negative numbers are included
- results have a float result

PseudoCode:
1. Create the code for the 1st input
2. Use an array with size 1 to help with writing when there is no average to compute
3. Create format code to help with the inputs
4. Use remainders by dividing by 10
5. Create a copy of the input number
6. Use that copy to get the sum of the numbers
7. Use the sum of the numbers to help divide up the numbers into even or odd
8. Make sure that negative numbers are included in the remainder check when dividing
9. Create code that terminates further inputs when 0 is entered
10. Have Global Variables to help with the iterations
11. Use a for loop with a massive number to help with gathering the inputs until it needs to break
12. Divide up the result and get it in a float format
