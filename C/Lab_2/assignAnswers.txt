Individual Assignment 1: Segmentation Faults
1. There was an error with line 22 meaning that the code expected a pointer argument but that the second argument was an integer.
2. I fixed it when I added the '&' operator in front of the input variable in line 22 similar to line 18.

3. The bug here is with the sum variables in both the main and read_values functions. For the main function, the '&' gets the memory address, and the '*' accesses the value which is stored at the memory address pointed by the pointer.
4. You fix it by placing the '&' in front of the sum variable which is in the read_files function. And in the read_values function, you add a '*' in front of every sum variable in that function.

Individual Assignment 2: Fix appendTest.c
1. This output is expected.
2. This output is not expected, because the append string does not reset. And the bug is in line 17 with the for loop. When changing s2len to "s2len + 1", it removes the \0, which is the punctuation. That fixes the issue.
3. This output is not expected, because there is a character limit which would not append everything in the limit which is 10 in the array.
